<p>2. “The 1950’s” This article is a general history overview of what was going on in the United States in the 1950’s. It goes through the beginning of the decade and carries on information throughout. Starting with the baby boomers and the movement of the country as a whole. The powerhouse the U.S. was becoming at the time and what the people, economy, and rest of the world were doing during this time. <br>
        This was published in 2010 by the history.com staff, similarly to the first article. There are links to other parts of the website as well as links to other articles similar to this one. The website is very updated, so I think the information is current. It is relevant to my story because I am focusing my story during the 1950’s and I need to get a nice background of what was going on at the time, it can help me with my plot as well as my character development. As  I mentioned above history.com is a very credible source and I trust the information it supplies, as it gives external links of the information. The info is accurate, as I trust history.com and what is has to say. The purpose this article is written is to give people some key points of what was going on in the 1950’s.

<p>3.”Alcohol is a problem when it’s a problem” Is an article talking about the social expectations for drinking and how it has changed over time. During different time periods drinking has spiked more than others and the discussion of when it is a problem is not very clear and never has been. Generationally it has been different and people's outlook is one of the biggest issues of that. 
        This article is not a recent article, being written in 1989. the New York Times keeps it on their updated website because of the information it has, as well as its level of importance at this point in time. The reason I like this article is because it talks about drinking during the 1950’s and how prevalent is was in society. As well as how it is represented in books movies, and magazines. I am going to bring this into my story and have the drinking of the time period shown through the story. It is from a very legitimate site in The New York Times, so I trust the information that it gives. Although it is an older article it had true and relevant facts at the time, and is still trustworthy information. The purpose of the article is to discuss the concept of “When is drinking bad?” this is something that has changed from generation to generation and I think it is interesting read about the differences drinking has gone through over time through generations. </p><br>

<p>5. Advertising in the 1950’s was an incredible time in history. Probably the most revolutionary time in the history of advertising the 1950’s exploded the industry. The innovations that were taking place at the time, like the development of TV made the AD industry skyrocket and the industry took a whole new path and has continued to do so ever since. 
        Published in 2003 this article is not recent, and most likely is not updated regularly, if at all. What this article focuses on is the world of Advertising during the 1950’s, which is something that happened, so it doesn’t need to stay up to date. But AdvertisingAge is a company that will only keep relevant articles on their website, and the history of Advertising is something that is important to know, even currently. This is what I want my main character to be involved in, and I want the historical references to be accurate. So it is important to know about what was going on in the Ad industry at the time, so my character can seem like a person who was doing what he was doing. Advertising Age is a pretty big company and website and is a very credible source. Staying up on all relevant news these days the website is full of information. Focusing on some historical information I trust what the website has to say, it also has links that can take me to similar information on the topic. The purpose is to educate people on the topic of Advertising, part of why learning history is so important is to learn what happened in the past, in order to help what is going on right now. </p><br>

<p>6. ‘1950’s Slang’ is an article written about all of the different words that were used during the 1950s and what they meant in today's words. It is set up in an alphabetical manner so you can see what all of these different sayings and words are like nowadays.
        Written in September this article is pretty recent and has videos throughout the article to give visual evidence about the way that people were talking at the time. This will be great for my story and the dialogue that I would like to use. Creating my character and making him feel real will only work if I can put him in this time period. So I am going to need to know the words they used in this time. The source of the info is Vintage Allies which is a very informative site with a great deal of topics you can check out. The purpose of this article is to give people a taste of what it was like in the 1950’s, with how people talked and what they looked like. I think this article was extremely helpful and had a great layout.</p><br>
